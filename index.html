      <h3 id="bio" class="bio-header">Biography</h3>
      <p class="indent">Carl Edward Sagan was an American astronomer, cosmologist, astrophysicist, astrobiologist,
        author, science popularizer,
        and science communicator in astronomy and other natural sciences. He is best known for his work as a science
        popularizer
        and communicator. His best known scientific contribution is research on extraterrestrial life, including
        experimental
        demonstration of the production of amino acids from basic chemicals by radiation. Sagan assembled the first
        physical
        messages sent into space: the Pioneer plaque and the Voyager Golden Record, universal messages that could
        potentially
        be understood by any extraterrestrial intelligence that might find them. Sagan argued the now accepted
        hypothesis
        that the high surface temperatures of Venus can be attributed to and calculated using the greenhouse effect.</p>
      <p class="indent">Sagan published more than 600 scientific papers and articles and was author, co-author or editor
        of more than 20 books.
        He wrote many popular science books, such as The Dragons of Eden, Broca's Brain and Pale Blue Dot, and narrated
        and
        co-wrote the award-winning 1980 television series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage. The most widely watched series in
        the
        history of American public television, Cosmos has been seen by at least 500 million people across 60 different
        countries.
        The book Cosmos was published to accompany the series. He also wrote the science fiction novel Contact, the
        basis
        for a 1997 film of the same name. His papers, containing 595,000 items, are archived at The Library of Congress.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">Sagan advocated scientific skeptical inquiry and the scientific method, pioneered exobiology and
        promoted the Search
        for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI). He spent most of his career as a professor of astronomy at Cornell
        University,
        where he directed the Laboratory for Planetary Studies. Sagan and his works received numerous awards and honors,
        including the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal, the National Academy of Sciences Public Welfare Medal,
        the
        Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction for his book The Dragons of Eden, and, regarding Cosmos: A Personal
        Voyage,
        two Emmy Awards, the Peabody Award and the Hugo Award. He married three times and had five children. After
        suffering
        from myelodysplasia, Sagan died of pneumonia at the age of 62, on December 20, 1996.</p>

      <q>One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any
        evidence
        of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s
        simply
        too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you,
        you
        almost never get it back.</q>
      <q>The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence.</q>
      <q>If you look at Earth from space you see a dot, that's here. That's home. That's us. It underscores the
        responsibility
        to deal more kindly and compassionately with one another and to preserve and cherish that pale blue dot, the
        only
        home we've ever known.</q>
      <q>I don't want to believe. I want to know.</q>
      <q>Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting fantasy.</q>
      <q>We are like butterflies who flutter for a day and think it is forever.</q>
      <q>It is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and
        reassuring.</q>
      <q>There are in fact 100 billion galaxies, each of which contain something like a 100 billion stars. Think of how
        many
        stars, and planets, and kinds of life there may be in this vast and awesome universe.</q>
      <q>Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were. But without it we go nowhere.</q>
      <q>If we continue to accumulate only power and not wisdom, we will surely destroy ourselves</q>
